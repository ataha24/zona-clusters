# zona-clusters
This repository contains:
1) clinical data (i.e., scores and stimulation volumes) for one deep brain stimulation (DBS) case example of the zona incerta
2) Notebooks to project DBS electrode coordiantes onto gradient and spectral clusters space for analysis of outcomes  

Zona incerta clusters were generated using the following [workflow](https://github.com/khanlab/subcorticalparc-smk/tree/zona_incerta_connectivity).
